# `.vscode\README.md`

This directory contains VS Code project workspace configuration files to streamline development for our "rust-newspaper" (Python/Flet based) project.

These configuration files currently provide some **project workspace settings** and **extension recommendations.**

Why this matters: These configuration files establish consistent coding standards while pragmatically respecting individual workflow preferences. New developers will hopefully find that **setup time is reduced**; while experienced developers hopefully appreciate having **well-documented VS Code configurations** tailored to this project.

**These VS Code workspace configuration files and related documentation should be kept up-to-date as this project evolves.** Ensuring that these configurations do not drift too far away from the development enviroment setups developers are using when working on this project.

Our aim ist to establish a development environment that balances flexibility and familiarity for each developer, while ensuring consistent standards where essential and a low-barrier to entry for newcomers.
